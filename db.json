The onion-shaped domes were designed to make the building look like flames on a bonfire. The cathedral was commissioned in the 1500s by Ivan the Terrible and according to legend, the Tsar thought it so beautiful he ordered that the architect be blinded so they would never surpass this creation."

As the site of epic gladiator battles, roaring crowds and jeering emperors, the historic atmosphere of this bloody arena is palpable.

          "description" : "Trajan’s Markets is a remarkable complex of ancient stores, administrative offices and alleyways that dates back to around 110CE. While historians debate whether or not it was actually a market, there’s no doubting that the covered area was the model for today’s shopping malls. Constructed by Emperor Trajan, one of Rome’s most industrious rulers, the ancient alleyways and multi-level offices at the complex give visitors a chance to step into the everyday life of ancient Romans. This tour also grants access to the onsite Imperial Forum Museum."
